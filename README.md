## Architecture

This project is structured to ensure scalability, maintainability, and ease of understanding. It utilizes **Vue 3** as the front-end framework, coupled with a modular approach for components, state management, and routing. 

The architecture follows **Component-Based** and **Declarative Programming** principles, allowing easy reusability of UI elements. We use the **Composition API** in Vue 3 to handle state and lifecycle hooks in a clean and concise manner.

Key architectural principles:
- **Component-based architecture**: Each part of the UI is a separate component, making the application easy to maintain and extend.
- **Separation of concerns**: State management, logic, and views are separated to maintain readability and modularity.
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component and function has a clear, single responsibility.

## Project Directory Structure

The project structure is designed to be clear and scalable. Here is a quick overview of the directory structure:

```

│   └── index.html               # Main HTML file
├── src/
│   ├── assets/                  # Static assets (images, fonts, etc.)
│   ├── components/              # Reusable UI components
│   ├── router/                  # Vue Router configuration

```

### File Naming Conventions
- **Assets**: PascalCase (e.g., `images` etc)
- **Views**: PascalCase (e.g., `Home.vue`, `About.vue`)

## Component Design

### Structure & Reusability
Components are designed to be modular and reusable. Each component performs one specific task and can be reused in multiple parts of the application. They are composed of:

1. **Template**: Defines the structure and markup.
2. **Script**: Contains component-specific logic.
3. **Style**: Scoped styling that applies only to the component.

Components can be easily composed to create more complex UI elements.

## State Management

For state management, we use **Vue's Provide/Inject API** for local state and **Pinia** for more complex global state management. This approach simplifies state management without the need for third-party libraries like Vuex, ensuring a more maintainable and readable codebase.

- **Local state**: Managed directly in components using Vue’s Composition API (via `ref`, `reactive`).
  
> **Note**: The Composition API and Pinia offer more flexibility compared to Vuex, and can be easily replaced with other libraries like **Zustand** or **Redux** if needed.

## Responsive Design & Cross-Browser Compatibility

The application is designed to be **responsive** and **mobile-first**, ensuring that the layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices. It uses CSS media queries and flexible grid layouts to accommodate various devices.

### Techniques:
- **CSS Grid & Flexbox**: For building flexible and dynamic layouts.
- **Responsive units**: Using `rem`, `em`, `%` for scalable units, and `vw`, `vh` for viewport-relative sizing.
- **Cross-Browser Compatibility**: Ensured by using autoprefixing (via PostCSS) and testing the app on various browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

---

## Performance Optimization
### Techniques Used:
- **Lazy Loading**: Components are lazy-loaded using **Vue Router**'s `component: () => import('...')` for non-critical views, like the "About" or "Projects" page.
- **Code Splitting**: Vue's built-in support for dynamic imports is used to split the app into smaller chunks.
- **Tree Shaking**: Unused code is eliminated during the build process to keep the final bundle size minimal.

---

## Web Performance

- **Prefetching**: Certain routes are preloaded using the `<link rel="prefetch">` tag to ensure faster navigation when transitioning between pages.
- **Service Workers**: Implemented to cache static assets, enabling the application to work offline or in low-network conditions.
- **Caching Strategies**: Optimized with strategies like cache-first and network-first to ensure the best performance.

---

## Testing

Testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability of the app. This project includes:
- **Unit Tests**: For testing Vue components and utility functions using **Jest** and **Vue Test Utils**.

---

## Styling & Design Systems

The styling is based on modern design principles, with a focus on creating clean and scalable styles:
- **Design Tokens**: Colors, typography, and spacing are defined using design tokens for consistency.
- **CSS Variables**: Used for theming (light/dark modes) and making styles easy to update.
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and animations are used to improve UX, e.g., for button hover effects and page transitions.

---

## Tooling

This project is built with the following tools:
- **Vite**: For fast build times and a smooth development experience.
- **ESLint**: To maintain code quality with consistent style.
- **Prettier**: For code formatting.
- **Jest & Vue Test Utils**: For testing and CI integration.

---

## Deployment

The project is deployed using **Netlify** which provide easy integration with GitHub for continuous deployment.

1. **Build Process**: The app is built using `vite build` which optimizes the app for production.
2. **Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Every commit pushed to the `main` branch triggers a build and deployment automatically.

---

## Third-Party API Integration

The portfolio app integrates with several third-party APIs to showcase different projects, blogs, and data:
- **Axios API**: Using Axios with async/await in JavaScript provides several benefits, especially when working with HTTP requests in web applications. It's more cleaner and better error handling.
